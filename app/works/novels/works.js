    name: "Noli Me Tangere",
    years: "1887",
    description:
      "José Rizal, our national hero, wrote a book. In Filipino, the title *Noli Me Tangere* means *Touch Me Not* or *Huwag Mo Akong Salingin*. What the Filipino people were going through at the time is reflected in the novel. He wrote it to make the Filipino people aware of the fact that the friars were mistreating, accusing, and oppressing them.",
    content:
      "The story primarily follows Crisóstomo Ibarra, a young, educated Filipino who returns to his homeland after seven years in Europe, filled with liberal ideas and a desire to improve his country. He plans to open a modern school to uplift his community.\n\nHowever, Ibarra quickly encounters the deeply entrenched corruption and abuses of power by the Spanish friars and the colonial government. Father Dámaso, a pompous and influential friar, is a central antagonist who harbors animosity towards Ibarra's deceased father, Don Rafael, a wealthy and respected man who clashed with the church.\n\nIbarra's efforts to establish his school are constantly thwarted by the machinations of the friars, particularly Father Dámaso and the scheming Father Salví. He also navigates a complex relationship with his childhood sweetheart, María Clara, a beautiful and devout young woman whose life is heavily influenced by the friars, especially her supposed father, Capitán Tiago, a wealthy and well-respected figure in society.\n\nAs Ibarra strives for progress, he uncovers the injustices and cruelty inflicted upon the Filipino people. He witnesses the friars' immense power, their exploitation of the natives, and their obstruction of education and reform. The novel also delves into the lives of other characters who suffer under the oppressive system, such as Sisa, a loving mother driven to madness by the loss of her sons due to the friars' abuses, and Elías, a mysterious and noble outlaw who represents the oppressed masses and becomes an ally to Ibarra.\n\nIbarra himself is eventually framed for rebellion due to the friars' conspiracies. He escapes prison with Elías's help, and in a dramatic escape on a boat, Elías sacrifices himself to save Ibarra.\n\nThe novel ends with Ibarra disappearing, María Clara entering a convent, and the seeds of revolution subtly planted. *Noli Me Tangere* is a scathing critique of the Spanish colonial regime, highlighting the corruption, social inequality, and the stifling influence of the Church, ultimately calling for reform and awakening a sense of national identity among Filipinos.",

    name: "El Filibusterismo",
    years: "1891",
    description:
      "This book, which translates to *The Reign of Greed*, was written by our national hero and is José Rizal's second book. In order to expose the moral decay of Spanish officials in the Philippines, Rizal portrayed a filibuster, or rebel, who represents himself. His propaganda novel *Noli Me Tangere* was followed by *El Filibusterismo*. The book was dedicated to the memory of the Gomburza, three priests who were charged with seditious, immoral, and illiterate behavior.",

      "Continuing the story 13 years later with a darker and more revolutionary tone.\n\nThe central figure is Simoun, a wealthy and enigmatic jeweler who is none other than Crisóstomo Ibarra in disguise. Presumed dead at the end of *Noli*, Ibarra has spent years amassing wealth and forging connections to orchestrate a revolution against the Spanish colonial government. His motivations are fueled by revenge for the injustices he suffered and the death of María Clara.\n\nSimoun subtly manipulates government officials and influential figures, encouraging corruption and oppression to ignite the people's anger and drive them to revolt. He establishes connections with various individuals, including the disillusioned Basilio, Sisa's son who is now a medical student, and Cabesang Tales, a former cabeza de barangay who has been unjustly deprived of his land.\n\nSimoun's grand plan involves a bomb disguised as a wedding gift at the wedding of Paulita Gómez (María Clara's cousin) and Juanito Peláez. The explosion is intended to kill high-ranking officials and signal the start of the uprising. However, his plan is thwarted by Isagani, Paulita's former love interest and the idealistic nephew of Father Florentino, who throws the lamp containing the bomb into the river.\n\nAs Simoun's revolutionary plot fails, he seeks refuge in the house of Father Florentino. Realizing the futility of his violent approach and consumed by his failures, Simoun takes poison. Before dying, he confesses his true identity and his motivations to Father Florentino, who emphasizes that freedom cannot be achieved through immoral means and that God's wisdom prevails. Father Florentino then throws Simoun's remaining jewels into the sea, symbolizing the rejection of greed and violence as paths to liberation.",

    name: "Makamisa",
    years: "1892",
    description:
      "*Makamisa* is an important, if unfinished, work by José Rizal, the national hero of the Philippines. This unfinished novel, which was found in 1987 by historian Ambeth Ocampo among Rizal's papers at the National Library, offers more information about Rizal's writing style and his critical viewpoint on Philippine society during the Spanish colonial era. Although it was never finished, Rizal started writing the manuscript in Spanish after it had been first drafted in pure Tagalog. The current fragment mainly concentrates on the actions of Padre Agaton, the town curate, and other townspeople, exploring the curate's enigmatic bad temper and carrying on Rizal's tradition of criticizing the friars and the social norms of the time. Because of this, *Makamisa* is a significant contribution to Rizal's body of work, giving academics and historians a better grasp of his opinions as well as an insight into the Tagalog language of the time.",
    content:
      "*Makamisa* is José Rizal's incomplete third novel, primarily written in Tagalog. The surviving fragment, a single chapter, portrays a scene in Tulig after mass, introducing characters like the moody Padre Agaton and worried Kapitan Lucas. Intended to emphasize Tagalog culture and ethics over politics, this unfinished work aimed for a more direct connection with the Filipino populace in their native tongue, offering a glimpse into Rizal's evolving literary and social concerns.",
