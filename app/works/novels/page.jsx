        "Jose Rizal our national hero wrote a book. In Filipino the title Noli Me Tangere means Touch Me Not or Huwag Mo Akong Salingin. What the Filipino people were going through at the time is reflected in the novel.

        "This book which translates to The Reign of the Greed was written by our national hero and is Jose Rizals second book. In order to expose the moral decay of Spanish officials in the Philippines Rizal portrayed a filibuster or rebel who is himself. His propaganda novel Noli me Tangere was followed by El Filibusterismo. The book was dedicated to the memory of the Gomburza three priests who were charged with seditious immoral and illiterate behavior. ",

        "Makamisa is an important if unfinished work by Jos√© Rizal the national hero of the Philippines. This unfinished novel which was found in 1987 by historian Ambeth Ocampo among Rizals papers at the National Library offers more information about Rizals writing style and his critical viewpoint on Philippine society during the Spanish colonial era. Although it was never finished Rizal started writing the manuscript in Spanish after it had been first drafted in pure Tagalog. The current fragment mainly concentrates on the actions of Padre Agaton the town curate and other townspeople exploring the curates enigmatic bad temper and carrying on Rizals tradition of criticizing the friars and the social norms of the time. Because of this Makamisa is a significant contribution to Rizals body of work giving academics and historians a better grasp of his opinions as well as an insight into the Tagalog language of the time.
