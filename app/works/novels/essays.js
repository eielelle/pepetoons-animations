      "This essay one of Rizals first conveyed his deep affection for his native country. It sought to reawaken Filipinos sense of patriotism and national identity. ",
    content:
      "Here is a beautiful subject, and because it is beautiful, it is very backneyed. Learned man, poet, artist, laborer, merchant, or soldier, old or young, king or slave- all have pondered it and devoted to it the most valued fruits of their intelligence, or of their hearts. From the cultured European, free, and proud of his glorious history, to the African Negro dragged out of his forests and sold for a paltry sum; from ancient peoples whose shadows still hover over their somber ruins-the tombs of their glories and sufferings-to the modern nations, full of activity and life, all, all have had and have an idol whom they call Motherland-beautiful, brilliant, sublime but implacable, haughty, and exacting. A thousand tongues have sung to her, a thousand lyres have offered her their most sonorous music; the most favored intellect have displayed before her memory, their most resplendent fineries. She has been the universal cry of peace, of love, and of glory because she is in the hearts and minds of all men, and like the light enclosed in limpid crystal, she goes forth in the form of the most intense splendors.\n\nAnd will this be an obstacle to us who wish to treat of her? And can we not dedicate to her something, we whose only sin is to have been born later? Would the XIXth century serve as an excuse for us to be ungrateful? No. The rich mine of the heart has not yet been exhausted. Her remembrance is always prolific, and no matter how little inspiration we have, positively we will find in the bottom of our soul, if not a rich treasure, a mite, poor but an enthusiastic manifestation of our sentiments. In the manner then of the ancient Hebrews who offered in the temple the first fruits of their love, we in foreign land will dedicate our first utterances to our country, enveloped in morning clouds and mist, always beautiful and poetic, and the more idolized by her sons when they are absent and far away from her. And this is not surprising, because it is a very natural feeling; because there in our country are first memories of childhood, a merry ode, known only in childhood, from whose races spring forth the flower of innocence and happiness; because there slumbers a whole past and a future can be hoped, because in her forests and in her meadows, on every tree, on every blade, on every flower you see engraved the memory of a being you love, as her breath in the perfumed breeze, her song in the murmur of the fountain, her smile in the rainbow of the sky, or her sighs in the confused moans of the night wind.\n\nIt is because you see there with the eyes of your imagination, under the tranquil roof of your old home, a family who remembers you and awaits you, thinking of you and worrying about you; in short because in her sky, in her sun, in her seas, and in her forests, you find poetry, tenderness, and love and even in the cemetery there is a humble tomb awaiting you to return you to the soil. Will there be a genie who will bind your heart to the soil of our native country, who beautifies and adorns everything, showing us all objects in a poetic and sentimental aspect and captivating our hearts. Because under whatever aspect she may appear, whether she is dressed in purple, crowned with flowers and laurels, powerful and rich; whether she is sorrowful and solitary, clad in rags and a slave, entreating her slave sons; whether she is a nymph in a pleasant garden beside the blue waves of the sea, gracious and beautiful as the dream of deluded youth; whether she is enveloped in a shroud of snow, sitting fatidically on the ends of the earth under a sunless and starless sky; whatever her name, her age, or her fortune might be, we love her always, as the child loves his mother even in the midst of hunger and misery, And how strange: The poorer and more wretched she is, the more one is willing to suffer for her, the more she is adored, the more one finds pleasure in bearing up with her.\n\nIt has been observed that the people of the mountains and wild valleys and those born on barren and dismal land are the very ones who can remember more vividly their country, finding in the cities a terrible boredom which compels them to return to their native land. Is it because love of country is the purest, most heroic, and most sublime human sentiment? It is gratitude; it is affection for everything that reminds us of something of the first days of our life; it is the land where our ancestors are sleeping; it is the temple where we have worshipped God with the candor of babbling childhood; it is the sound of the church bell which has delighted us since a child; they are the vast fields, the blue lake, the picturesque banks of the river which we pass by in a nimble boat; the limpid brook which laves the cheerful little house nestling among flowers like a love-nest; or the tall mountain which inspire us this pleasant sentiment?\n\nWill it be the raging storm that lashes, and knocks down everything it finds on its way; the lightning which, escaping from the hands of the Almighty annihilates everything; will it be the avalanche or cascade, matters of perpetual motion and endless menace? Is it all this that attracts, captivates, and entices us? Probably these beauties or tender remembrances fortify the tie that unites us to our native land, engendering a pleasant feeling of wellbeing when we are in our country, or deep melancholy when we are far away from her, the origin of a cruel disease called nostalgia. Oh! Never sadden the stranger who arrives at your shores; do not awaken in him that vivid memory of his country, the comforts of his home, because then you will evoke this sickness, tenacious phantom that will not abandon him until he sees again his native land or he arrives at the border of the tomb. Never pour a drop of bitterness in his heart, for in such circumstances the sorrows are exaggerated compared with the happiness of the lost home.\n\nWe are born, then grow up, we get old, and we die with this pious sentiment. IT is perhaps the most constant if there is constancy in the hearts of men, and it seems that it does not abandon us even in our very tombs. Napoleon, seeing dimly the dark bottom, of the grave, remember his France whom he loved extremely, and in his exile he entrusts to her his remains, confident that he will find more comforting rest in her midst. Ovid, more unfortunate, and divining that not even his ashes would return to Rome, dying on the shores of the Black Sea, consoled himself with the thought that if not he, at least his verses would reach the Capitol. As children we love games; as adolescent we forget them; as young men we search for our ideal; disappointed, we weep over it and we go seeking for something more positive and more useful; as fathers, our children die; and time rubs out our griefs as the air of the sea obliterates the shoreline as the ship moves away from it.\n\nBut, on the other hand, love of country is never effaced once it has penetrated the heart, because it carries with it a divine stamp which renders it eternal and imperishable. It has been said that love has always been the most powerful force behind the most sublime actions. Well then, of all loves, that of country is the greatest, the most heroic and the most disinterested. Read history, if not, the annals, the traditions. Go to the homes, what sacrifices, selfdenial and tears are held on the sacred altar of the nation. From Brutus, who condemned his sons charged with treason, to Guzman the Good who allowed his son to die in order not to fail in his duty, what dramas, what tragedies what martyrdom have not been enacted for the welfare of that inexorable divinity who has nothing to give you in return for your children but gratitude and blessings! And notwithstanding, with the pieces of their hearts they raise glorious monuments to their motherland; with the work of their hands, with the sweat of their brow, they have sprinkled and made fruitful her sacred tree, and neither have they expected nor received any reward.\n\nSee there a man sunk in his study. For him his best days are passing away, his sight weakens, his hair turns gray and gradually disappears with his illusions; his body stops. For years he has been after a truth; he solves a problem; hunger and thirst, cold and heat; sickness and misfortune have successively confronted him. He is going down his grave and avails of his agony to offer to his motherland a rosette for her crown, a truth- fountain and origin of a thousand benefits. Turn your eyes to another direction: a man tanned by the sun scratches the ungrateful soil to plant a seed. He is a farmer. He too contributes with his modest but useful work to the glory of his nation.\n\nThe motherland is in danger! Soldiers and leaders as if by charm spring from the ground. The father leaves his children, the sons leave their parents and all rush to defend their common mother. They bid farewell to the quiet pleasures of the home and hide under their helmets the tears that tenderness draws. They all leave and die. Perhaps he is the father of many children, fair and pinkish like cherubs; perhaps he is a young man of smiling hopes- a son or a lover-it does not matter. He has defended the one who gave him life he has fulfilled his duty. Peter or Leonides, whoever he might be, the Motherland will know how to remember him. Some have sacrificed for her their youth, their pleasure; others have dedicated to her the splendors of their genius; others shed their blood; all have died, bequeathing to their Motherland an immense fortune; Liberty and glory. And what has she done for them? She mourns them and proudly presents them to the world, or posterity and to her children to serve as an example.\n\nBut alas, if at the magic of your name, oh Motherland, the most heroic virtues shine; if in your name superhuman sacrifices are made, on the other hand, what injustices…! From Jesus Crist who, all love, has come to the world for the welfare of humanity and dies for it in accordance with the laws of his motherland, to the most obscure victims of modern revolutions, how many, alas, have not suffered and died for you, usurped by others. How many victims of rancor, of ambition, or of ignorance have not expired blessing you and wishing you all kind of happiness!\n\nFair and grand is the Motherland when her children at the cy of battle, get ready to defend the ancient land of their ancestors; cruel and arrogant when she sees from her throne the terrified foreigner flee before the invincible phalanx of her sons. But when her sons, divided into rival factions, destroy one another: when anger and rancor devastate fields, towns, and cities; then ashamed, she tears away her robe and hurling her scepter, she put on mourning clothes for her dead sons. Whatever our condition might be then, let us love her always and let us wish nothing but her welfare. Thus we shall labor in conformity with the purpose of humanity dictated by God which is the harmony and universal peace of his creatures, You who have lost the ideal of your souls, you who, with wounded hearts, have seen your illusions disappear one by one and like the trees in autumn you find yourselves without flowers and without leaves, and desirous of loving, find no one worthy of you, there you have the Motherland: Love her.\n\nYou who have lost a father, mother, brother, wife, child, in short, love, upon which you have founded your dreams, and you find in yourselves a deep and horrible void, there you have the Motherland: Love her as she deserves. Love her! Oh, yes! But not as they loved in other times by performing ferocious acts, denied and condemned by true morals and mother nature; by making a display of fanaticism, destruction, and cruelty, no. A more promising dawn, in short, of true Christianity, the prelude to happy and peaceful days. It is our duty to follow the arid but peaceful and productive paths of science which lead to progress, and thence to the unity desired and asked by Jesus Christ on the night of his sorrow.",

      "The harsh realities that Filipino farmers faced—the injustices and exploitation they endured—were vividly portrayed by Rizal in this essay. He made the factors that led to the nations economic backwardness public. ",
    content:
      'We applaud the efforts of the minister of colonies to foster agriculture in the Philippines. Proofs of these are the boards, commissions, and committees and numerous projects. We suggest, however, that the farmer be consulted also, the one in direct contact with the land, who makes the land productive with his capital and labor and puts into practice the measures that science and experience suggest.\n\nAnd not only must he not forgotten but neither must his hands are tied, disabling them for work, as it happens, unfortunately. It is not enough to issue royal decrees and timely measures; they must be enforced and enforced expediently.\n\nThe Filipino farmer has to struggle not only with plagues and public calamities but also with petty tyrants and robbers. Against the first, defense indeed is permitted; against the latter, not always. We shall explain.\n\nAfter the floods, locusts, fires, bad harvests, and the like, the farmer capitalist has to deal with the constable who takes away from him his laborers for personal service, some public works, repair of roads, bridges, and others; with the civil guard who arrests them for various reasons, sometimes for not carrying with them their personal cedulas (certificates), for not saluting properly, for being suspicious persons or for no reason whatsoever, and they menacle them to clean the barracks and thus compel the capitalist to live on better terms with the chief and, if not, they take away his carabaos, oxen, in spite of many protests, returning them later however, as these acts of violence are almost always unjustified and not within the competence of the civil guard. The work is usually delayed three or four days only but at times it is delayed weeks, the animal is lost or dies; and this happens when the civil guard, going beyond its jurisdiction or province, commits these plunders in another province and then returns to its own; hence the question of competency; the coming and going, etc., etc., etc.\n\nAt times, it is not the constable or the civil guard who opposes so indirectly the minister of colonies. An official of the court or of the provincial government, dissatisfied with the farmer, urgently summons this or that laborer, if not two or three. The unfortunate man undertakes a trip of two or three days, uneasy and distrustful, spends his savings, arrives, presents himself, waits, returns, returns the next day and waits, finally to be asked with a frown and the look of a judge, abstruse and unknown things. He is lucky if he comes out free from this questioning, for not infrequently after it, he is sent to jail from which he comes out later as stupid as before and all are as Christian as ever.\n\nSometimes, rare fortunately, a compania volante (flying squad) sweeps the province. Woe to those who have enemies! It is enough to be in the list of suspects for the head of the squad to pick him up and take him to another place without trial or filing of a complaint. Goodbye farm and goodbye everything! See if after this he will be encouraged to plant in other islands.\n\nBut if the capitalist knows how to grease and through offerings to appease the gods and render them favorable, he has already accomplished much. But still there remain other deities, the tulisanes or bandits.\n\nThe tulisan is a terrible enemy of those whose farms are far from the towns. One cannot win his favor by giving him gifts or bribing him, as some do secretly, because he would fall into the opposite abyss and would be accused of being an accomplice of malefactors, which is equivalent to being tortured and later exiled. The best remedy against this plague that the government cannot destroy is to arm oneself and expose oneself to a daily and dangerous combat.\n\nWell now; for the peaceful tax-payer to use firearms and to be able to defend himself, he needs the good report of the people, the civil guard, and the parish priest, to petition the government in Manila, to have patience, to wait because the petition is not always acted upon except after the end of several months if someone follows it up or if he has a friend of the employee in charge of issuing licenses.\n\nAll this is very good. What is not so good is that despite the good reports, despite the peace in the province, the abundance of bandits, the good conduct of the farmer tax-payer, and the danger to which he and his farms are exposed, they deny him not only the use of the firearm, or the renewal of the license but also they confiscate the firearm, which he bought at a fabulous price sometimes, only to be left to rot, to become oxidized, in a corner of the barracks or the town hall, useless to all, except to the bandits, who in this way are the most favored.\n\nThis is the case of a citizen of the province of La Laguna; owner of extensive lands planted to sugar cane, coffee, and abaca located far from the town. That province has been for almost three centuries not only to loyal Spain but "super loyal", one Indio in that province, Captain Francisco de San Juan, having declared war in the name of Spain against the English in 1762 when even the government was submitting to the invader, succeeding with his energy to save the money that the authorities wanted to deliver to the enemy within bounds. This made me say to a Spanish writer that that Indio was half a century ahead of the Mayor of Mostoles. However, La Laguna is one of the most agricultural provinces, most liable to natural and human calamities, this citizen is denied the renewal of his license, and in spite of all the good reports, they confiscated his firearm. For this reason he had to abandon his farms, losing his abaca crops, for he could not venture out unarmed and he was sure that the authorities who left him thus could neither defend him nor ransom him from the bandits.\n\nWe are convinced that the minister of colonies and the good Spaniards who love the prestige of Spain and have affection for those Islands do not know these details. We, who can cite names, towns, dates, witnesses, and attest other incidents through our own experience or as eye-witnesses, are content to cite this case and we say: Je passe et des meilleurs.\n\nIt would be desirable to correct this, Mr. Minister of Colonies, lest some mischievous men say that the government there being impotent might come to an understanding with the bandits and deliver to them the unarmed inhabitant, that it wants the lands to be cultivated with speeches, projects, and boards and for this reason it binds the hands of the farmer and puts a thousand obstacles on his path, so that he may plant according to the new system. Agriculture is not improved only in that way. It is necessary to aid those who practice it. Those who from their comfortable chairs think otherwise and see the inefficacy of the royal decrees throw the blame for this backwardness to the indolence of the Indio. They do not know with what obstacles he has to contend and they ignore that for a machine to run well, it is enough that it be built according to principles but also that it be perfect in its details, that everything be leveled, and that no part get out of its proper place.\n\nThese abuses, that for being unutterably bad become ridiculous, ruin the country and impair the prestige of the government. This system of prevention, of unfounded fears, of unjust suspicions, not only irritates and awakens men but exposes the weakness of the government: Much fear reveals much weakness. This, added to the inability to stop banditry, makes an evil-minded person say that the government is only hard on peaceful and respectable citizens while it fondles or lets alone the rebellious and criminal. This is the usual reproach of independent Indios on Christianized Indios.\n\nThis behavior of the government there hurts the real interests of Spain and through this way of making discontented men; the government appears as the foremost filibustero. And as we believe that one cannot serve a country better than to tell her the truth, we say this to the Mother Country so that she can apply timely remedy. Hence, we ask for representation in the Cortes and freedom of the press in Manila in order to expose abuses to public opinion. Injustices there do not always find a writer who may relate them, nor every article a generous newspaper that will accept it for its columns; and even if it were not so, through the present road, the remedy always arrives late, if the abuse is remedied at all.\n\nWe shall conclude by proposing to the minister a reform concerning the granting of licenses for the use of firearms.\n\nInasmuch as they are not granted without the report of the people, of the chief of the civil guard (European), and of the parish priest (almost always European), instead of being issued in Manila, they should be issued by the court of every town, after previous consultation or secret voting of the judge, of the officer of the civil guard (European), and of the parish priest (almost always European). It should not be granted without unanimity. In this way, it is simplified and the business is shortened, and the time is better employed. There are no other inconveniences but these two: There would be some more unemployed men and hidden enmities could not be satisfied with revenge and secret reports, but on the other hand, the treasury and mankind would be the gainer – the treasury with less employees and mankind with more loyal men and less traitors.',

Womens education is crucial and Rizal highlighted their role in determining the countrys future. He emphasized that women must be strong moral and enlightened. ",
    content:
      'When I wrote Noll Me Tangere, I asked myself the question whether bravery was a common thing in the girls of our people. I brought back to my recollection and reviewed those I had known since my infancy, but there were only few who seemed to come up to my ideal. There was, it is true, an abundance of girls with agreeable manners, beautiful ways, and modest demeanor, but there was in all an admixture of servitude and deference to the words or whims of their so-called "spiritual fathers", due to excessive kindness, modesty, or, perhaps, ignorance. They seemed faded plants, sown and reared in darkness, having flowers without perfume and fruits without sap.\n\nHowever, when the news of what happened at Malolos reached us, I saw my error, and great was my rejoicing. After all, who is to blame me? I did not know Malolos nor its girls, except one called Emilia, and her I knew by name only.\n\nNow that you have responded to our first appeal in the interest of the welfare of the people; now that you have set an example to those who, like you, long to have their eyes opened and be delivered from servitude, new hopes are awakened in us and we now even dare to face adversity, because we have you for our allies and are confident of victory. No longer does the Filipino stand with her head bowed nor does she spend her time on her knees, because now she is quickened by hope in the future; no longer will the mother contribute to keeping her daughter in darkness and bring her up in contempt and moral annihilation. And no longer will the science of all sciences consist in blind submission to any unjust order, or in extreme complacency, nor will a courteous smile be deemed the only weapon against insult or humble tears the ineffable panacea for all tribulations. You know that the will of God is different from that of the priest; that religiousness does not consist of long periods spent on your knees, nor in endless prayers, big rosaries, and grimy scapularies, but in a spotless conduct, firm intention and upright judgment. You also know that prudence does not consist in blindly obeying any whim of the diosdiosan, but in obeying only that which is reasonable and just, because blind obedience is itself the cause and origin of those whims, and those guilty of it are really to be blamed. The official or the friar can no longer assert that they alone are responsible for their unjust orders, because God gave each of you reason and a will of your own to distinguish the just from the unjust; you were all born without shackles and free, and nobody has a right to subjugate the will and the spirit of another. And, why should you submit to another our thoughts, seeing that thought is noble and free?\n\nIt is cowardice and error to believe that saintliness consists in blind obedience and that prudence and the habit of thinking are presumption. Ignorance has ever been ignorance, and never prudence and honor. God, the primal source of all wisdom, does not demand that man, created in his image and likeness, allow himself to be deceived and hoodwinked, but wants us to use and let shine the light of reason with which he has so mercifully endowed us. He may be compared to the father who gave each of his sons a torch to light their way in the darkness, bidding them keep its light bright and take care of it, and not to put it out and trust to the light of the others, but to help and advise each other to find the right path. They would be madmen were they to follow the light of another, only to come to a fall, and the father could upbraid them and say to them: "Did I not give each of you his own torch?"; but he could not say so if the fall were due to the light of the torch of him who fell, as the light might have been dim and the road very bad.\n\nThe deceiver is fond of using the saying that "it is presumptuous to rely on one\'s own judgment", but, in my opinion, it is more presumptuous for a person to put his judgment above that of others and try to make it prevail over theirs. It is more presumptuous for a man to constitute himself into an idol and pretend to be in communication of thought with God; and it is more than presumptuous and even blasphemous for a person to attribute every movement of his lips to God, to represent every whim of his as the will of God, and to brand his own enemy as an enemy of God. Of course, we should not consult our own judgment alone, but hear the opinion of others before doing what may seem most reasonable to us. The cassock or the cowl does not give wisdom: the wild man from the hills, if clad in a priest\'s robes, remains a hillman and can only deceive the weak and ignorant. And, to make my argument more conclusive, just buy a priest\'s robe as the Franciscans wear them and put it on a mare, and you will be lucky if the mare does not become lazy on account of the robe. But I will leave this subject to speak of something else.\n\nYouth is a flower-bed that is to bear rich fruit and must accumulate wealth for its descendants. What offspring will be that of a woman whose kindness of character is expressed by mumbled prayers, who knows nothing by heart but awits, novenas, and alleged miracles, whose amusement consists in playing panguingue or in the frequent confession of the same sins? What sons will she have but acolytes, priest\'s servants, or cockfigters? It is the mothers who are responsibe for the present servitude of our compatriots, owing to the unlimited trustfulness of their loving hearts, to their ardent desire to elevate their sons. Maturity is the fruit of infancy and the infant is formed on the lap of its mother. The mother who can only teach her child how to kneel and kiss hands must not expect sons with blood other than that of vile slaves. A tree that grows in the mud is unsubstantial and good only for firewood. If her son should have a bold mind, his boldness will be deceitful and will be used by him for evil purposes; it will be like the bat that can not show itself until the ringing of vespers. They say that prudence is sanctity and the love of God. But what sanctity have they shown us? To pray and kneel a lot, kiss the hands of the priests, throw money away on churches, and believe all the friar sees fit to tell us: tattle, callous knees, wiping of the nose.\n\nAs to the mites and gifts to God, is there anything in the world that does not belong to God? What would you say of a servant making his master a present of a cloth borrowed from that very master? Who is so vain, so insane that he will give alms to God and believe that the miserable thin he has given will serve to clothe the Creator of all things? Blessed be they who succor their fellow men, aid the poor and feed the hungry; but cursed be they who who turn a deaf ear to the supplication of the poor, who only give to him who has plenty and spend their money lavishly on silver altar hangings for the church, or give it to the friar, who lives in abundance, in the shape of fees for masses of thanksgiving, or in serenades and fireworks. The money ground out of the poor is bequeathed to the master so that he can provide for chains to subjugate and hire thugs and executioners. Oh, what blindness, what lack of understanding!\n\nSaintliness consists in the first place in obeying the dictates of reason, happen what may. "It is acts and not words that I want of you", said Christ. "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in Heaven". Saintliness does not consist in abjectness, nor is the successor of Christ to be recognized by the fact that he gives his hand to be kissed. Christ did not give the kiss of peace to the Pharisees and never gave his hand to be kissed. He did not cater to the rich and vain; he did not mention scapularies, nor did he make rosaries, or solicit offerings for the sacrifice of the mass or exact payment for his prayers. Saint John did not demand a fee on the River Jordan, nor did Christ teach for gain. Why, then, do the friars now refuse to stir a foot unless paid in advance? And, as if they were starving, they sell scapularies, rosaries, belts, and other things which are nothing but schemes for making money and a detriment to the soul; because even if all the rags on earth were converted into scapularies and all the trees in the forests into rosaries, and if the skins of all the beasts were made into belts, and if all the priests of the earth mumbled prayers over all this and sprinkled oceans of holy water over it, this would not purify a rogue or condone sin where there is no repentance. Thus also, through cupidity and love of money, they will, for a price, revoke the numerous prohibitions, such as those against eating meat, marrying close relatives, etc. You can do almost anything if you but grease their palms. Why that? Can God be bribed and bought off, and blinded by money, nothing more nor less than a friar? The brigand who has obtained a bull of compromise can live calmly on the proceeds of his robbery, because he will be forgiven. God, then, will sit at a table where theft provide the viands? Has the Omnipotent become a pauper that he must assume the role of the excise man or gendarme? If that is the God whom the friar adores, then I turn my back upon that God.\n\nLet us be reasonable and open our eyes, especially you women, because you are the first to influence the consciousness of man. Remember that a good mother does not resemble the mother that the friar has created; she must bring up her child to be the image of the true God, not of a blackmailing, a grasping God, but of a God who is the father of us all, who is just; who does not suck the life-blood of the poor like a vampire, nor scoffs at the agony of the sorely beset, nor makes a crooked path of the path of justice. Awaken and prepare the will of your children towards all that is honorable, judged by proper standards, to all that is sincere and firm of purpose, clear judgment, clean procedure, honesty in act and deed, love for the fellowman and respect for God; this is what you must teach your children. And, seeing that life is full of thorns and thistles, you must fortify their minds against any stroke of adversity and accustom them to danger. The people can not expect honor nor prosperity so long as they will educate their children in a wrong way, so long as the woman who guides the children in his first steps is slavish and ignorant. No good water comes from a turbid, bitter spring; no savory fruit comes from acrid seed.\n\nThe duties that woman has to perform in order to deliver the people from suffering are of no little importance, but be they as they may, they will not be beyond the strength and stamina of the Filipino people. The power and good judgment of the woman of the Philippines are well known, and it is because of this that she has been hoodwinked, and tied, and rendered pusillanimous; and now her enslavers rest at case, because so long as they can keep the Filipina mother a slave, so long will they be able to make slaves of her children. The cause of the backwardness of Asia lies in the fact that there the women are ignorant, are slaves: while Europe and America are powerful because there the women are free and well educated and endowed with lucid intellect and a strong will.\n\nWe know that you lack instructive books; we know that nothing is added to your intellect, day by day, save that which is intended to dim its natural brightness; all this we know, hence our desire to bring you the light that illuminates your equals here in Europe. If that which I tell you does not provoke your anger, and if you will but pay a little attention to it, then, however dense the mist may be that befogs our people, I will make the utmost effort to have it dissipated by the bright rays of the sun, which will give light, though they may be dimmed. We shall not feel any fatigue if you will help us; God, too, will help to scatter the mist, because He is the God of truth; He will restore to its pristine condition the fame of the Filipina, in whom we now miss only a criterion of her own, because good qualities she has enough and to spare. This is our dream; this is the desire we cherish in our hearts; to restore the honor of woman, who is half of our heart, our companion in the joys and tribulations of life. If she is a maiden, the young man should love her not only because of her beauty and her amiable character, but also on account of her fortitude of mind and loftiness of purpose, which quicken and elevate the feeble and timid and ward off all vain thoughts. Let the maiden be the pride of her country and command respect, because it is a common practice on the part of Spaniards and friars here who have returned from the Islands to speak of the Filipina as complaisant and ignorant, as if all should be thrown into the same class because of the missteps of a few, and as if women of weak character did not exist in other lands. As to purity, what could the Filipina not hold up to the others! Nevertheless, the returning Spaniards and friars, talkative and fond of gossip, can hardly find time enough to brag and bawl, amidst guffaws and insulting remarks, that a certain woman was thus; that she behaved thus at the convent and conducted herself thus with the Spaniard who on one occasion was her guest, and other things that set your teeth on edge when you think of them; things which, in the majority of cases, were faults due to candor, excessive kindness, meekness, or, perhaps, ignorance, and were all the work of the defamer himself. There is a Spaniard, now in high office, who has sat at our table and enjoyed our hospitality in his wanderings through the Philippines, and who, upon his return to Spain, rushed forthwith into print and related that on one occasion in Pampanga he demanded hospitality and ate and slept at a house, and that the lady of the house conducted herself in such and such a manner with him: this is how he repaid the lady for her supreme hospitality! Similar insinuations are made by the friars to the chance visitor from Spain concerning his very obedient confesandas, hand-kissers, etc., accompanied by smiles and very significant winkings of the eye. In a book published by D. Sinibaldo de Mas and in other friar sketches sins are related of which the women accused themselves in the confessional and of which the friars made no secret in talking to their Spanish visitors, seasoning them, at the best, with idiotic and shameless tales not worthy of credence. I can not repeat here the shameless stories that friar told Mas and to which Mas attributed no value whatever. Every time we hear or read anything of this kind, we ask each other: Are the Spanish women all cut after the pattern of the Holy Virgin Mary and the Filipinas all reprobates? I believe that if we were to balance accounts in this delicate question, perhaps ... But I must drop the subject, because I am neither a confessor nor a Spanish traveler and have no business to take away anybody\'s good name. I shall let this go and speak of the duties of woman instead.\n\nA people that respects woman, like the Filipino people, must know the truth of the situation in order to be able to do what is expected of it. It seems an established fact that when a young student falls in love, he throws everything to the dogs—knowledge, honor, and money, as if a girl could not do anything but sow misfortune. The bravest youth becomes a coward when he marries, and the born coward becomes shameless, as if he had been waiting to get married in order to show his cowardice. The son, in order to hide his pusillanimity, remembers his mother, swallows his wrath, suffers his ears to be boxed, obeys the most foolish order, and becomes an accomplice to his own dishonor. It should be remembered that where nobody flees, there is no pursuer; when there is no little fish, there can not be a big one. Why does the girl not require of her lover a noble and honored name, a manly heart offering protection to her weakness, and a high spirit incapable of being satisfied with engendering slaves? Let her discard all fear, let her behave nobly and not deliver her youth to the weak and faint-hearted. When she is married, she must aid her husband, inspire him with courage, share his perils, refrain from causing him worry, and sweeten his moments of affliction, always remembering that there is no grief that a brave heart can not bear and there is no bitterer inheritance than that of infamy and slavery. Open your children\'s eyes so that they may jealously guard their honor, love their fellow-men and their native land, and do their duty. Always impress upon them that they must prefer dying with honor to living in dishonor. The women of Sparta should serve you as an example in this; I shall give you some of their characteristics.\n\nWhen a mother handed the shield to her son as he was marching to battle, she said nothing to him but this: "Return with it, or on it", which meant, come back victorious or dead, because it was customary with the routed warrior to throw away his shield, and the dead warrior was carried home on his shield. A mother received word that her son had been killed in battle and the army routed. She had not say a word, but expressed her thankfulness that her son had been saved from disgrace. However, when her son returned alive, the mother put on mourning. One of the mothers who went out to meet the warriors returning from battle was told by one that her three sons had fallen. I do not ask you that, said the mother, but whether we have been victorious or not. We have been victorious—answered the warrior. If that is so, then let us thank God, and she went to the temple.\n\nOnce upon a time a king of theirs, who had been defeated, hid in the temple, because he feared the popular wrath. The Spartans resolved to shut him up there and starve him to death. When they were blocking the door, the mother was the first to bring stones. These things were in accordance with the custom there, and all Greece',
