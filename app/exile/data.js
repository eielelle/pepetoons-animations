        description: "Madrid, where José Rizal spent much of his time in Europe from 1882 to 1891, honors him with a monument in Parque Santander along Avenida de Filipinas. Arriving in 1882 after studying at the University of Santo Tomas, Rizal described Madrid as a city blending European and Oriental influences. Despite the city's distractions, he remained dedicated to literary, artistic, and patriotic pursuits. Unveiled on December 5, 1996, the monument features a four-meter-high bronze statue by Filipino artist Florante Caedo, standing near the statue of South American hero Simón Bolívar, symbolizing Rizal's lasting connection to Spain.",
