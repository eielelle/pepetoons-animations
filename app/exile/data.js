        description: "Dr. Jos√© Rizal visited Singapore four times, with his first visit in 1882 during a two-day stopover for sightseeing before departing for Europe on May 11. He returned on May 17, 1892, marking his last visit before his execution on December 30, 1896. To honor his visits, a memorial featuring a bronze medallion by a Filipino artist was unveiled near the Asian Civilizations Museum in 2005 by Singaporean President S.R.
